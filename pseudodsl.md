# PseudoDSL documentation

This the the PseudoDSL documentation, powered by [LocSys](https://locsys.issel.ee.auth.gr/). PseudoDSL enables the creation of modern applications with minimal lines of code.

The PseudoDSL is textual and resembles languages like Python, C, or Assembly. It has been created with a direct link to the [AppCreator DSL](https://github.com/robotics-4-all/appcreator-documentation/blob/main/README.md), since a program in PseudoDSL can be transformed to a program in AppCreator and vice versa.
